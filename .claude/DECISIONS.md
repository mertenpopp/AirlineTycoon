## 2026-09-02 — Comparison session (no code changes)

Compared `Bot*` (MertenBot) against `ClaudeBot*` at HEAD 16d5116c. Three 300-game batches.

| Matchup | ClaudeBot (HA) | Bot |
|---|---|---|
| Solo (`run_measurement_claudebot.sh` / `run_measurement_bot.sh`) | 8.364e9 (med 8.545e9) | 11.032e9 (med 11.06e9) |
| Head-to-head (`run_competition.sh`, lvl 24) | 2.337e9 (med 1.802e9) | 2.879e9 (med 3.170e9), wins 240/300 |

Both bots survive to day 99 in 300/300 of every batch — the old "Bot liquidates ClaudeBot
by day 39" failure is gone.

Where the solo gap comes from (day-99 lifetime totals; the CSV columns other than
Saldo/Gewinn/Verlust are cumulative `BilanzGesamt`, not per-day):

- Operating revenue: Bot 12.115e9 vs ClaudeBot 9.312e9.
  - Tickets: 11.824e9 vs 9.257e9. Jobs: 0.198e9 vs 0.054e9. Freight: 0.093e9 vs 0.0005e9.
- ClaudeBot draws on 2 job sources (travel agency + domestic freight); Bot's `BotPlaner`
  draws on 5 (adds last-minute, international passenger, international freight) and solves
  with simulated annealing instead of greedy gap-filling.
- Efficiency: Bot 2.42M pax on 134 planes / 28 routes (272 pax per flight); ClaudeBot 1.64M
  on 200 planes / 130 routes (202 pax per flight). ClaudeBot spreads over ~5x the routes,
  pays 2.3x the route rent and 2.8x the ad spend, and ends with image 530 vs Bot's 721.
- ClaudeBot's fuel is *cheaper in scored terms* (-0.760e9 vs Bot's -0.914e9): `KerosinGespart`
  is not in `GetOpVerlust()`, so Bot's tank arbitrage saves cash the metric never credits.
  ClaudeBot's `kUseFuelArbitrage = false` is correct for this objective.

Head-to-head: ClaudeBot ends at the overdraft floor (Geld = -1e7) in 300/300 games, Bot in
0/300. ClaudeBot's outcome is bimodal — 213/300 plateau at ~1.8e9 with 50-80 planes, 25
break out to 120-200 planes and ~7.9e9. Its self-holding is still 8,000 shares
(`executeStock` emits max with mode 0; `buyStock` appears nowhere in ClaudeBot.cpp) while
Bot rebuys to 51% and books 1.71e9 of Takeovers.

Caveat: both scripts run Bot at BotLevel 2. Level 3 is the threshold for
`ROBOT_USE_MUCH_SABOTAGE` (Player.cpp:7915) and lowers `threshNoRun` so it runs between
rooms (Bot.cpp:309). ClaudeBot at level 4 always sets `Running = TRUE`. Bot wins with a
handicap.

Next candidates for ClaudeBot, in expected-value order:
1. Concentrate routes: cap `kRoutePairsPerHundredPlanes` far below 38 and push image/planes
   into fewer pairs — the 130-route spread is where revenue per flight is lost.
2. Add last-minute and international job sources (`ACTION_CHECKAGENT1`,
   `ACTION_CALL_INTERNATIONAL`) — Bot earns 3.7x on jobs and 174x on freight.
3. Buy back to 51% of own stock in `executeStock`; add a nemesis stake.

### Correction + A/B on the takeover (same session)

My first pass reported "ClaudeBot eliminated in 0/300". That was wrong: I tested for the
fleet dropping to zero. `GameMechanic::bankruptPlayer` (GameMechanic.cpp:38) does call
`Planes.ReSize(0)`, but the player's *statistics freeze at their last recorded values*, so
`Flugzeuge` never reads 0 in the CSV. The reliable signature is
`Geld == 2 * DEBT_GAMEOVER == -10,000,000` together with `SaldoGesamt` constant to day 99.

Corrected numbers, head-to-head (`run_competition.sh`, lvl 24):

| build | ClaudeBot taken over | median day | ClaudeBot saldo | Bot saldo |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| current (gate present) | **281/300** | 78 | 2.337e9 | 2.879e9 |
| A/B: `isLateGame()` gate removed | **300/300** | 39 (min 33, max 48) | 4.06e7 | 1.185e10 |

So ClaudeBot's 2.337e9 is a frozen day-78 snapshot, not a day-99 result. The 19 games it
survives are its good ones: median 8.09e9 on 200 planes vs Bot's 1.00e9. In the 281 it
loses: median 1.79e9 on 62 planes. Legacy player FL is taken over in 299/300 too.

Cause established by A/B, not inference: commit `e7590e17` (2026-09-02) added
`if (!isLateGame()) return Prio::None;` to `Bot::condBuyNemesisShares`. `isLateGame()` is
fleet >= 12, which Bot reaches at median day 78 in this matchup. Reverting that single line
and re-running 300 games reproduces the old day-39 liquidation exactly. ClaudeBot's own
share code is unchanged since it was first added (`git log -S executeStock`), so the gate
merely bought it 39 days - the blind spot itself is untouched.

This raises the priority of the 51% self-stake fix: it is worth ~6.3e9 of head-to-head
score (the survivors' 8.09e9 median vs the 1.79e9 of the games it loses), which dwarfs the
route-concentration and job-source items above.

(`src/BotConditions.cpp` was patched temporarily for the A/B and has been restored; build
re-installed from clean sources.)
